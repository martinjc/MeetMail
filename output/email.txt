Hello All,
        Welcome to the September edition of meetups in and around Cardiff. As usual, we will be heading to the PyDiff meetup as a school outing, but please let us know if there is a meetup you want a group to attend and we will try to organise it! Here is what we have this month and these meetups are only successful because fine people like yourselves keep the Cardiff dev community alive. 
 See you there!
